# NeuroVision-X: A Foundation Model for Cross-Modal Perception and Reasoning

## Abstract
One paragraph problem, method, results, implications.

## 1. Introduction
Motivation, limitations of unimodal systems, contributions.

## 2. Related Work
Foundation vision, VLMs (BLIP-2, LLaVA), video understanding (VideoMAE), text-to-3D, digital twins.

## 3. Method
### 3.1 Perception backbones
### 3.2 Vision-language fusion (Q-Former)
### 3.3 Reasoning with tool-use
### 3.4 Generative heads (image + 3D)
### 3.5 Training objectives and losses
### 3.6 Safety & alignment (RLHF hooks)

## 4. Experiments
Datasets, metrics, ablations, qualitative results.

## 5. Deployment
ONNX/TensorRT, real-time demos, edge constraints.

## 6. Ethics & Risk
Bias, privacy, regulatory notes (esp. healthcare).

## 7. Conclusion & Future Work
